Frequent pattern mining apriori and fpgrowth


Groceries data analysis, which aims to discover how items purchased by customers in a supermarket (or a store) are associated. An example association rule is Cheese -> Beer [support = 10%, confidence = 80%]. The rule says that 10% customers buy Cheese and Beer together, and those who buy Cheese also buy Beer 80% of the time.Support and confidence are two measures of rule strength.

Support(A) = (Transactions containing (A))/(Total Transactions) Confidence(A→B) = (Transactions containing both (A andB))/(Transactions containing A) Lift(A→B)=(Confidence(A→B))/(Support(B))

A rule’s confidence is a measurement of its predictive power or accuracy. The confidence tells us the proportion of transactions where the presence of item or itemset LHS results in the presence of item or itemset RHS.
